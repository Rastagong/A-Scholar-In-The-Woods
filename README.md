A Scholar In The Woods
======================
* A short interactive story written by @Rastagong (http://rastagong.net)  
* Based on Python 3, Pygame 1.9.2 and my own RPG engine, the Narro Engine (v0.2). Repo: https://github.com/Rastagong/narro)
* This game was made for the Ludum Dare 26, an awesome game jam. Ludum Dare page: http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=3761

* You should use the _Releases_ folder rather than the _Trunk_. There are a compo version and a post compo version with a few fixes added after the deadline.  
  For each version, both the sources and the Windows/Linux builds are available.

Installing the game
----------------------
On Windows:
1. Grab a Post Compo build for Windows from the _Releases/Post Compo_ folder.  
2. Unzip it somewhere, and launch play.exe.

On Linux:
1. Grab a Post Compo RPM package from the _Releases/Post Compo_ folder, or an Ubuntu build.  
2. Install it on your system.
Alternatively, you can build the game from the sources if you have the required dependencies.

Building  the game from the sources
----------------------
1. Requirements  
   Make sure Python 3, Pygame 1.9.2 or higher and Numpy are installed.  
   As of May 9, 2013, there are only pre-releases of Pygame 1.9.2. You will find them on the Pygame website: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.  
   If you don't find them there, you may try here for Windows: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.  
   For Linux, you'll have to look in the Mercurial repo: https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads.  

2. Download the Post Compo sources from the _Releases/Post Compo_ folder of the repo and unzip them somewhere.  

3. Run "python play.py" to launch the game.
